- **ZED2i Integrated IMU**  
  - Overview lists ZED2i IMU (45 Hz).  
  - Topic list has ZED2i images, depth, and VIO, but no IMU topic.

### 4 Suitability verdict & to-dos

**Verdict:** **Suitable** for ISAAC-style offline training. You have direct coverage for base twists, joint states, previous actions, and commanded twists; gravity is recoverable from IMUs; the only notable gap is the **pre-sampled 108-height vector**, which is straightforward to compute from the available LiDAR. Noise must be **added in sim** using dataset-fit parameters.

**To-dos to match ISAAC exactly:**
1. **Terrain sampler:** LiDAR ‚Üí base-frame point cloud ‚Üí rolling 2.5D height map ‚Üí sample 108 fixed offsets around the base each step.  
2. **Gravity estimator:** Smooth IMU accel and/or use orientation to extract gravity vector; validate against estimator pose if available.  
3. **Noise calibration:** Estimate per-channel œÉ from empirical residuals (encoders vs actuator state, IMU vs odom, odom vs CPT7 IE) and configure ISAAC sim-to-real noise to match.

## üìù Summary

- **Mission A (11-29-55)** includes **extra GNSS and filtered LiDAR data**: tightly/loosely coupled CPT7 IE odometry, GNSS raw/RT, and navsatfix fields.  
- **Mission B (11-47-44)** is missing those, but otherwise aligns closely in core sensors (IMUs, cameras, depth, LiDAR raw, actuator states, etc.).
